# GenHTTP.Modules.ServerCaching

This module allows content generated by the server
to be cached, so that it can be served very fast the
next time it is requested.

For examples and additional details, please refer to
[the documentation](https://genhttp.org/documentation/content/concerns/server-caching/).
