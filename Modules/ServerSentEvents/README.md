# GenHTTP.Modules.ServerSentEvents

This package allows to push events to connected
clients as they happen, without adding the complexity
of a full-duplex websocket connection.

For examples and details, please refer to
[the documentation](https://genhttp.org/documentation/content/handlers/server-sent-events/).
