# GenHTTP.Engine.Kestrel

This package provides the Kestrel server engine
to be used in GenHTTP applications.
You will typically reference the `GenHTTP.Core.Kestrel` meta
package instead, which features a reference to this
package.

For information on how to use the server within
your projects, see [the documentation](https://genhttp.org/documentation/).

Please note that you can use any sample provided
by the documentation and just replace the core
package to work with Kestrel instead of the internal
engine.

For limitations and considerations regarding the
engine to be used, see [this comparison](https://genhttp.org/documentation/server/engines/).
